2011-09-20 1.2.1: [bug] Fixed JSON whitespace bugs (reported by Rob Moss)
                  [bug] Fixed broken ocamldoc links for polymorphic
                        create_* functions (reported by Rob Moss)

2011-07-02 1.2.0: [+ui] new modes -t -b -j -v -dep -list standardizing
                        file name and structure and simplifying the
                        command-line
                  [+ui] new "from" annotation for abstract types
                        defined in modules following the _t/(_b|_j|_v)
                        module suffix convention:
                        type foo <ocaml from="Bar"> = abstract
                  [+ui] all json-specific options now start with -j-
                        and are ignored in non-json modes (old names are
                        preserved for backward compatibility)
                  [+ui] new validator mode (-v, -validate)
                  [+ui] new options -j-strict-fields and
                        -j-custom-fields for handling unknown JSON
                        fields instead of skipping them.
                  [+ui] new -j-defaults option that forces output of 
                        JSON fields with default values
                  [!!!] optional record fields now skipped if
                        their value is null
                  [+ui] convenience module Ag_util reading/writing
                        channels and files
                  [+ui] redefinition of OCaml types that are not
                        predefined ATD types is now possible (char,
                        int32, int64, ref, array).
                  [bug] biniou int8 can now be read as OCaml chars.
                        The following now works, as documented in the manual:
                        int <ocaml repr="char"> <biniou repr="int8">
                  [bug] empty OCaml record types now cause an error

2011-02-11 1.1.1: [+ui] added renaming option for OCaml types taken
                        from other modules:
                          type foo <ocaml_biniou module="Foo" t="t"> = abstract
                  [bug] fixed bad output for option types other than
                        field values with -std-json

2010-12-08 1.1.0: [pkg] requires biniou >= 1.0.0, yojson >= 1.0.0, atd >= 1.0.0
                  [!!!] string_of_ functions generated by atdgen -biniou
                        now take an optional ?len:int argument instead
                        of a mandatory int.
                  [+ui] support for shared and cyclic values with biniou
                  [+ui] support for JSON objects as association lists
                  [+ui] new <ocaml[_biniou|_json] module=...> annotation
                        for predefined and abstract types
                  [+ui] -extend option to define aliases to types defined
                        in another OCaml module
                  [+ui] read from stdin if no input file is given
                  [+ui] write anonymous module to stdout with -o -
                  [+ui] source location modifiers -pos-fname and -pos-lnum
                  [opt] solved slow compilation of code produced for
                        records with many optional fields (biniou/ocamlopt)

2010-09-13 1.0.1: [doc] added INSTALL file and example/

2010-09-09 1.0.0: initial release
