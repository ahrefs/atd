ATD project - Static Types for Json APIs
==

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ahrefs/atd/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ahrefs/atd/tree/master)

ATD stands for Adaptable Type Definitions. It is a syntax for defining
cross-language data types. It is used as input to generate efficient
and type-safe serializers, deserializers and validators.

Target programming languages currently supported:
* C++: [atdcpp](atdcpp)
* DLang: [atdd](atdd)
* Java: [atdj](atdj)
* OCaml, Melange: [atdgen](atdgen)
* Python: [atdpy](atdpy)
* Scala: [atds](atds)
* TypeScript: [atdts](atdts)

Export to other interface description languages (IDLs):
* JSON Schema: [`atdcat -jsonschema`](atdcat)

Tools to work with ATD files:
* [atdcat](atdcat): check syntax, reformat, expand inherited definitions,
  export to JSON Schema, ...
* [atddiff](atddiff): compare two revisions of a given ATD interface and
  report incompatibilities.

All can installed with opam e.g.
```
$ opam install atdgen
```
