Now:
- update documentation for ArrayList and for variants

Later:
- write to a buffer rather than concatenating strings (for performance)
- produce an output tree using Atd_indent rather fprintf
  (for clarity and atdj performance)
- variant implementation: avoid memory leak by clearing previous field
- translate atd syntax tree first, then generate code instead of doing
  everything in the same pass (for clarity and atdj performance)
- merge into atdgen
- support top-level lists
- add support for lists of lists
- add location information to exceptions (need own parser)
