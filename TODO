* Website and documentation refresh: move pages to mjambon.com/atdgen,
  fix broken links pointing to the defunct oss.wink.com, create single
  sub-site for everything atdgen-related (biniou, yojson, atd, atdgen,
  atdgen-omake, atdgen-make, documentation)

* Support JSON object syntax for variants, e.g.:
  type t = A | B of int
  Currently supported: "A"
                       ["B", 123]
                       <"A">
                       <"B":123>
  To do: {"A": null}
         {"B": 123}

* Find a good way to support variants represented as records whose type is
  given by one of their fields.

* Support records/variants with identical field/constructor name in
  the same module (ocaml >= 4.01)

* Plans for atdgen 2:
  - imply -std-json, i.e. do not produce code that produces JSON
    in the extended syntax for variants (<"A">, <"B":123>)
    or tuples (("a", 123, {"x":0}))
  - make it possible to produce all outputs in one call to atdgen.
    "atdgen foo -m tjv" would read file "foo.atd" and produce
     files foo_{t|j|v}.{ml|mli}
  - use classic variants instead of polymorphic variants by default
    since ocaml >= 4.01 makes them easier to use
  - call the executable "atdgen2" if that helps
