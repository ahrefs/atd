         A type expression is one of the following:

         - [Record]: a record type (within curly braces)
         - [Tuple]: a tuple (within parentheses)

         e.g. [string option]
         - [Nullable]: adds a null value to a type.
         [Option] should be preferred over [Nullable] since
         it makes it possible to distinguish [Some None] from [None].
         - [Shared]: values for which sharing must be preserved. Such
         type expressions may not be parametrized. Values may only
         be shared if the source location of the type expression is the same.
         - [Wrap]: optional wrapping of a type. For example, a timestamp
         represented as a string can be wrapped within a proper time type.
         In that case, the wrapper would parse the timestamp and convert
         it into the internal representation of its choice. Unwrapping
         would consist in converting it back to a string.
         - [Name]: a type name other than [list] or [option], including
         the predefined types [unit], [bool], [int], [float], [string]
