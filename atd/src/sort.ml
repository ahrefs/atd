(*
   Topological sort that doesn't give up on cycles:

   A --> B
   C --> D        gives: [A] [B C] [D]
   B --> C
   C --> B

   The complexity of this algorithm is in O(N^2), although it is plenty
   fast for the application.

   TODO: use the Kosarajuâ€“Sharir algorithm which is simpler and has a linear
   complexity. A good description of the algorithm is given here:

     Algorithm outline:

     Input: directed graph
     Output: a list of node groups sorted topologically, i.e.
             for any group A coming after group B and any node n_a in A
             and any node n_b in B, there is no edge
             going from n_b to n_a.
             ... such that the number of groups is maximum.

     Initialization:
     Build graph structure such that allows following edges both forward
     and backward.

     1. root and leaf elimination: a leaf is a node without outgoing edges,
        a root is a node without incoming edges.
     2. partitioning into strict ancestors (left), cycle (middle),
        and strict descendants (right), and other (independent):
        pick an processed node V (our pivot), determine the set of
        descendant nodes and the set of ancestor nodes by following edges
        from V respectively forward and backward.
        Nodes that belong both to the descendant set
        and to the ancestor set form a cycle with V and are removed
        from the graph.
        Strict ancestors are sorted starting from step 1, strict descendants
        are sorted starting from step 1.
