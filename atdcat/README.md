atdcat
======

`atdcat` is a development tool for working with the ATD language. It
checks the syntax of an ATD file and reformats it. Options offer
transformations of the type definitions that can be useful for 
troubleshooting. Check out `atdcat --help` for the list of available options.

The most noteworthy transformation offered by atdcat is `atdcat -jsonschema` 
which translates an ATD file to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
