Formerly required field 'becomes_optional' is now optional but has a default value.
You must ensure that new implementations always populate the JSON field
with a value (using atdgen's option -j-defaults or equivalent) so that older
implementations can read newer data. If this is already the case, use
'atddiff --json-defaults-old' to disable this warning.
The following types are affected:
